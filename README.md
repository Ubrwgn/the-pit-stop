============

Not quite sure yet, I'm a newbie. But I'm eager to learn. About two months ago I began taking courses online from various sources. Some free and some paid. So far I've covered the following subjects. HTML5, CSS3, {LESS}, JavaScript, Bootstrap 3, Chrome Dev Tools, Brackets, HTML5 Game Development and currently studying PHP and mySQL. I've taken classes in some of these subjects from more than one resource. I've had three JavaScript classes and two HTML/CSS classes. And there have been a couple of classes that were so horrible and so badly put together that I, along with others, just abandoned them. 
I've read in several places that GitHub in an invaluable resource. I'm a total noob to programming so I'm hoping one of you can clue me in to how I can benefit from GitHub.
My background is in the desktop publishing industry, pre-press production and all things associated with printing. So, I'm having to learn all new software and I decided to start with HTML and work my way up. 
Any advice is welcome as long as you don't try to speak over my head too much.
